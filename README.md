# Dr Bimmer AI

This repository contains a minimal prototype for **Dr Bimmer AI**, an automotive diagnostics and shop management platform. The project features a FastAPI backend and a lightweight React-based frontend.

## Backend
- Located in `backend/`
- Start with `uvicorn app.main:app --reload`
- Unit tests in `backend/tests`

## Frontend
- Located in `frontend/`
- Open `index.html` directly in the browser for a demo

This prototype demonstrates basic API endpoints and a simple WebSocket connection. It does not yet integrate with real AI models or AR interfaces.
